            Ten days ago, I wrote about new beginnings. Today, I'm writing about 
            the terrifying, exhilarating process of actually following through.

            I spent this week learning Rust. Not because I need it for work—my 
            day-to-day is mostly Python and JavaScript—but because I wanted to 
            understand memory management at a deeper level. There's something 
            humbling about going from feeling competent to feeling like a complete 
            beginner again. Every error message is a puzzle, every successful 
            compilation feels like magic.
          </p>

            The thing about trying new things is that it forces you to confront 
            your own limitations. I thought I understood programming concepts 
            until I had to think about ownership and borrowing. It's like learning 
            to drive in a country where the rules of the road are completely 
            different—you have to unlearn instincts that have become second nature.

            At Verizon, we're experimenting with some new AI frameworks that just 
            came out. The team lead asked if anyone wanted to take point on 
            researching them. Six months ago, I would have waited for someone 
            else to volunteer. This time, I raised my hand. The learning curve 
            has been steep, but there's something addictive about that feeling of 
            your brain stretching to accommodate new concepts.

            Photography side note: I tried shooting street photography for the first 
            time this weekend. The anxiety of pointing a camera at strangers is 
            real, but I captured this moment of an elderly man feeding pigeons that 
            I'm actually proud of. Sometimes the best shots happen when you're 
            willing to be uncomfortable.

            The common thread in all of this is that growth doesn't happen in the 
            planning phase. It happens when you're willing to look foolish, to 
            ask stupid questions, to build something that might not work. The 
            comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing grows there.
          </p>

            Next week: maybe I'll finally try that Japanese cooking class. Or 
            maybe I'll keep pushing on this Rust project until it actually does 
            something useful. The point isn't the specific thing—it's the practice 
            of choosing curiosity over comfort, over and over again.
