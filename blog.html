            Today marks the beginning of something new. After months of planning, 
            overthinking, and second-guessing, I've finally decided to embrace the 
            uncertainty that comes with starting fresh.

            The tech industry moves fast—faster than most of us can keep up with. 
            Just when you think you've mastered a framework, three new ones have 
            already emerged. It's exhausting, but also exhilarating. There's 
            something beautiful about being in a constant state of learning, 
            where every day presents an opportunity to be humbled by how much 
            you don't know.

            I've been at Verizon for a while now, working on AI solutions and 
            ML models. The work is challenging in ways I never anticipated. It's 
            not just about writing clean code or implementing algorithms—it's about 
            understanding people, their needs, and how technology can serve them 
            without losing the human element.

            My fiancé and I have been planning our next adventure. We've been 
            talking about Japan for years, and something about this season of life 
            feels right for taking that leap. There's something about immersing 
            yourself in a completely different culture that forces you to grow 
            in ways you can't predict.

            Photography has been my escape lately. There's a meditative quality 
            to capturing moments—trying to freeze time in a way that tells a story 
            without words. I've been experimenting with film again, embracing 
            the imperfections that come with analog processes. Sometimes the 
            most beautiful things happen when you relinquish control.

            This blog is part of that new beginning. A space to document the 
            journey, the failures, the small victories, and everything in between. 
            Not for anyone else necessarily, but as a reminder to myself that 
            growth happens in the messy middle, not at the destination.
